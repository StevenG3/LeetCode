Create table If Not Exists Activity (player_id int, device_id int, event_date date, games_played int)
Truncate table Activity
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-03-01', '5')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-03-02', '6')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('2', '3', '2017-06-25', '1')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('3', '1', '2016-03-02', '0')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('3', '4', '2018-07-03', '5')

SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT player_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity),2) AS fraction 
FROM Activity 
WHERE (player_id, event_date) IN
